## Overview
 The goal of the game is to guess a secret number between 1 and 20 with the highest score possible.
 For every guess you get wrong you lose 1 point.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Put a number into the input and press the "check" button
- see some text that indicates whether the user needs to guess higher or lower 
- see the UI will change colour when the user guesses correctly.
- to press the "again" to rest the game

## My process


### Built with
- javascript
- html
- css

### What I learned
Within this project I learnt what's the DOM and DOM manipulation, selecting and manipulating elements and css styles, handling click events, implementing game logic and high scores, and refactoring code using the DRY principal.

### Continued development
Improve my use of breakpoints for better responsive designs and start using a mobile first workflow.
